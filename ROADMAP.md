## PHASE 1 — Fix The Cracks (Engine Integrity)
*These are gaps that silently hurt quality. Fix before growing.*

- [x] **1.1 — Worker purify-cv: dedup pass**
  - Added prefix-based dedup (first-6-word key) after tense-flipping in `handlePurifyCv()` in `handlers/purify.ts`
  - Prevents duplicate bullets for job-agent and direct API consumers
  - Deployed: worker version `13a83637` → superseded by Phase 1 deploy

- [x] **1.2 — Close the Leak Miner → Purify loop**
  - Added dynamic KV pass in `handlePurifyCv()`: fetches `cv:banned:all` after static `_SUBS` pass, applies leak-miner-promoted phrases to summary, experience bullets, and project descriptions
  - Wrapped in try/catch so KV outage is graceful
  - Self-improvement loop is now closed

- [x] **1.3 — Wire the 3 dead tables into the brief**
  - `cv_openers`, `cv_context_connectors`, `cv_result_connectors` now read in `buildBriefData()` — 6 → 9 parallel KV reads
  - Brief now returns `opener_suggestions` (4 random), `result_connectors` (top 6 by score), `context_connectors` (6)
  - Single biggest quality win — directly improves HR detector verb-saturation score

- [x] **1.4 — `handleClean` input length guard**
  - Capped rawText to 50 000 chars in `handleClean()` in `handlers/validation.ts`
  - Prevents abuse and worker timeout from huge payloads

---

## PHASE 2 — Beat Resume Worded (Score My CV)
*Direct competitor killer. Build after Phase 1 is solid.*

- [ ] **2.1 — "Score My CV" full feature**
  - Composite score (0–100) across 5 dimensions already built: ATS Compatibility (`/api/cv/validate`), Human Voice Score (`hrDetectorSimulation`), Bullet Quality (`cvQualityGate`), Career Progression (`cvSeniorityCoherence`), JD Match (`/api/cv/semantic-match`)
  - UI: upload/paste CV → optional JD → parallel score → expandable per-dimension panels with exact failing bullets → "Fix My CV Automatically" CTA
  - Anti-gaming: 72% JD match = green ✅, 95% = amber ⚠️ "looks keyword-stuffed"
  - Zero new infrastructure — all endpoints already exist
  - **Effort:** 3–4 days

- [ ] **2.2 — Career Pivot Score page**
  - When `cvSeniorityCoherence` or field detection detects background field ≠ JD field, don't penalise — explain
  - Show: "Career Pivot Detected: Agri-Engineering → Software Dev", what transfers, what gaps, what to add
  - Resume Worded marks this as a bad CV. ProCV explains and helps fix it.
  - **Effort:** 1 day

- [ ] **2.3 — LinkedIn Score page**
  - Basic LinkedIn headline + summary scorer (re-use `cvQualityGate` logic adapted for LinkedIn text format)
  - Free — funnel users into the CV generation flow
  - Competes for Resume Worded's #1 keyword ("LinkedIn resume checker") on Google
  - **Effort:** 2 days

---

## PHASE 3 — Expand the Engine (Seed Data + Field Coverage)

- [ ] **3.1 — Add 9 missing field profiles**
  - Use the Admin CV Engine page already built
  - Missing: `nursing_medical`, `accounting_audit`, `hospitality_tourism`, `real_estate_property`, `media_journalism`, `construction_site`, `customer_success`, `research_academia`, `supply_chain_logistics`
  - Each needs: `jd_keywords[]`, `preferred_verbs[]`, `avoided_verbs[]`, `metric_types[]`
  - **Effort:** 1 day

- [ ] **3.2 — Add missing seniority + field combos**
  - Currently 23 combos out of 85 possible (17 fields × 5 levels = 85). Covering ~27%.
  - Most critical: `entry+healthcare_clinical`, `entry+education_teaching`, `junior+data_analytics`, `senior+finance`, `lead+product_management`, `entry+sales_commercial`, `mid+communications_marketing`, `senior+hr_people`
  - Each combo needs `forbidden_phrases[]` — what sounds wrong at that level in that field
  - **Effort:** 3 hours

- [ ] **3.3 — Voice-specific summary formulas**
  - All 13 voices currently use the same 4-line summary structure
  - Add `summary_formula` to each voice profile in `cv_voice_profiles` so `analytical_thinker` (verbosity 4) produces a different shape than `hands_on_builder` (verbosity 2)
  - **Effort:** 1 day

- [ ] **3.4 — Rhythm patterns for Projects + Education sections**
  - `current_role`, `past_role`, `internship`, `summary` have rhythms — `projects` and `education` have none
  - Scenario C (no experience, has projects) is hurt most — projects are the main work history but get no rhythm enforcement
  - Add: `project_showcase`, `project_minimal`, `education_rich` patterns
  - **Effort:** 2 hours

- [ ] **3.5 — Cover letter brief injection**
  - Cover letter generation uses the same system prompt as CV generation but never receives the brief
  - Voice chosen for the CV is ignored for the cover letter → they sound like different people
  - Fix: pass the same brief used for CV generation as additional context in the cover letter prompt
  - **Effort:** 3 hours

- [ ] **3.6 — Verb energy routing by seniority**
  - Every verb has `energy_level` (high/medium/low) — tracked in DB but never used
  - Senior/Lead CVs should lead with high-energy verbs; Entry CVs should use medium/low
  - Sort `verbPool` by energy level before slicing to 30, based on seniority tier
  - **Effort:** 1 hour

---

## PHASE 4 — Distribution & Monetization

- [ ] **4.1 — SEO proxy landing pages**
  - Target Resume Worded's top keywords: `/ats-checker`, `/cv-score`, `/resume-checker/software-engineer`, `/resume-checker/kenya`, `/resume-checker/nigeria`
  - Each page = lightweight Score My CV tool (Phase 2.1) + "Fix My CV" CTA
  - **Effort:** 1 week

- [x] **4.2 — Server-side generation tracking foundation**
  - `cv_events` table exists (migration 015) — tracking skeleton is in place
  - *Next: wire actual event writes into `handleTieredLLM` and `handleParallelSections` before any paid gating*

- [ ] **4.3 — Remove download gate reset button**
  - The download gate modal has a "Reset my counter" button — users bypass the gate instantly
  - Remove the reset button. Track downloads server-side in D1 via cv_events.
  - **Effort:** 30 minutes

- [ ] **4.4 — Stripe integration (Global Payments)**
  - Free: 3 CV generations/month, 2 downloads, Score My CV unlimited
  - Pro ($8/mo): unlimited generations, all features, cover letter, priority models
  - BYOK (free forever): bring Groq/Gemini key — all features, user pays AI costs
  - Score My CV stays free forever — it is the acquisition funnel, not the product
  - **Effort:** 2–3 days
